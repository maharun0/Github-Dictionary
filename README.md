## How to pull request?

To initiate a pull request on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository:** Start by forking the repository you want to contribute to. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository:** Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

3. **Create a new branch:** Move into the cloned repository directory and create a new branch to work on your changes. It is recommended to use a descriptive branch name that reflects the nature of your changes.


4. **Make and commit changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code or files in the repository. Once you are satisfied with the changes, commit them with an appropriate commit message.


5. **Push changes to your fork:** Push the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:

6. **Open a pull request:** Visit the original repository on GitHub and you should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click on it to open a new pull request.

7. **Review and discuss:** Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you have made. It is a good practice to mention any related issues or provide additional context.

8. **Submit the pull request:** Finally, submit the pull request, and the repository owner will review your changes. You can continue the discussion on the pull request page if any further changes or clarifications are required.

# Pull request in own repository?

If you want to submit a pull request to your own repository, the process is similar to the steps mentioned above. You would still need to fork your own repository, create a new branch, make the desired changes, and open a pull request from the branch. This can be useful when working on a new feature or making improvements to your own project.

# Pull request to other's repository?

When submitting a pull request to someone else's repository, the process is slightly different. Instead of forking your own repository, you will need to clone the original repository directly, create a new branch, make the necessary changes, and push them to your branch. After that, you can open a pull request to the owner's repository, following the steps outlined earlier. Make sure to clearly explain the purpose of your changes and provide any relevant information in the pull request description.

Remember, when contributing to other repositories, it's always a good practice to check the repository's guidelines, contributing guidelines, and any specific instructions mentioned in the repository's documentation or README file.

That's it! You're now ready to make pull requests on GitHub and contribute to open source projects or collaborate with others in a smooth and efficient manner.

# üêº Integrate changes from remote 'main' to your local branch (even if your local branch is behind main)

If your intention is to integrate changes from the remote 'main' branch into your local 'zerodha-with-html-and-css' branch and your local branch is behind the remote, you should first checkout your local branch and then merge the remote main branch into it. Here are the steps:

1. Switch to Your Local Branch:

  `git checkout zerodha-with-html-and-css`

2. Merge Changes from Remote main Branch:
   `git merge origin/main`

This will merge changes from the main branch of the remote repository (referred to as origin) into your local branch. If there are no conflicts, the merge should proceed smoothly. If there are conflicts, Git will notify you, and you'll need to manually resolve them.
